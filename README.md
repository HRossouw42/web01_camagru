## Disclaimer
*This was my first attempt at any web development, before this point it was pure C.*  

Combine a very short deadline with innexperience and you get this. **Expect üêû's.** Sanitization is rare - this is a rookie project through and through.  

Still, looking at it 2 years later, I learned a lot from it. Make mistakes early, fail fast, improve constantly.
